                        advance in the web development. As I was forced to convert my profession and passion at the
                        covid time, I was totally clueless about how I could go forward on the web development. It might
                        be December 27, 2021 when I was informed about the web development course by Jhankar Mahbub. As
                        per I can remember, December 20 might be the last date to be enrolled. Though time was over I
                        emailed to Programming Hero about my interest, but I was disallowed. However, I was enrolled for
                        Batch 6, but struggled because of lacking in JavaScript Basic and could not continue the course.
                        I am grateful to Mr. Jhankar and Programming Hero that I have got another chance to excel my
                        effort. Inshallah, I will be succeed in this time. </p>
